System Analysis and Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass is a company that is developing a way to help learning drivers become better prepared for their drivers’ test. They offer resources like online practice testing and in person drive training. These benefits can be accessed through a web based mobile application. DriverPass wanted us to design an application that would allow the students to access their own personal accounts. Allow admin the ability to manage accounts and update their terms based on the changes with the DMV’s policy.  

What did you do particularly well?

The design and execution of activity diagrams. Making sure to have a design that flowed well and allowed the view to be guided through the document. The diagrams also didn’t include a lot of bloat and only included information that was relevant to the process being discussed. 


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would have revised the use case diagram from project 2. I would have used colors to represent actors and implemented the use of an index to inform the viewer as to what color corelated to the actor. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

During the meetings with DriverPass I made a note as to who was all in attendance. I made a list of all requirements that we asked of the DriverPass team. This allowed me to ensure that no request was overlooked. It was very important to include all needs within the project to reduce time on planning. Providing more efficiency for the development team. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

The most important aspect of designing software is the practice of revision. Laying all information out and making changes until everything is clear and concise. Leaving no room for misunderstandings as to what is being asked. That is just for the analyzing of a system. It is also important to have many tools at our disposal to visualize the project like all diagrams used within these two projects. Words to paper is great but having something to view as to how all the “dots connect.”
